# Direct-Link
Generate direct download link for Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive

Paste a public link to any Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive file and get a link that automatically starts downloading when entered (without opening any webpage or asking for confirmation). 

UPDATE: Doesn't work with new Google Drive files (Google requires sign-in for downloading)!
